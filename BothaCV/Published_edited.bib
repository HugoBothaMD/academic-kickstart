	abstract = {The consensus criteria for the diagnosis and classification of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) have served as an important tool in studying this group of disorders. However, a large proportion of patients remain unclassifiable whilst others simultaneously meet criteria for multiple subtypes. We prospectively evaluated a large cohort of patients with degenerative aphasia and/or apraxia of speech using multidisciplinary clinical assessments and multimodal imaging. Blinded diagnoses were made using operational definitions with important differences compared to the consensus criteria. Of the 130 included patients, 40 were diagnosed with progressive apraxia of speech (PAOS), 12 with progressive agrammatic aphasia, 9 with semantic dementia, 52 with logopenic progressive aphasia, and 4 with progressive fluent aphasia, while 13 were unclassified. The PAOS and progressive fluent aphasia groups were least impaired. Performance on repetition and sentence comprehension was especially poor in the logopenic group. The semantic and progressive fluent aphasia groups had prominent anomia, but only semantic subjects had loss of word meaning and object knowledge. Distinct patterns of grey matter loss and white matter changes were found in all groups compared to controls. PAOS subjects had bilateral frontal grey matter loss, including the premotor and supplementary motor areas, and bilateral frontal white matter involvement. The agrammatic group had more widespread, predominantly left sided grey matter loss and white matter abnormalities. Semantic subjects had bitemporal grey matter loss and white matter changes, including the uncinate and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculi, whereas progressive fluent subjects only had left sided temporal involvement. Logopenic subjects had diffuse and bilateral grey matter loss and diffusion tensor abnormalities, maximal in the posterior temporal region. A diagnosis of logopenic aphasia was strongly associated with being amyloid positive (46/52 positive). Our findings support consideration of an alternative way of identifying and categorizing subtypes of degenerative speech and language disorders.},

	abstract = {Functionally related brain regions are selectively vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. However, molecular markers of this pathophysiology (i.e., beta-amyloid and tau aggregates) have discrepant spatial and temporal patterns of progression within these selectively vulnerable brain regions. Existing reductionist pathophysiologic models cannot account for these large-scale spatiotemporal inconsistencies. Within the framework of the recently proposed cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease, however, these large-scale patterns are to be expected. This model postulates the following: 1) a tau-associated, circumscribed network disruption occurs in brain regions specific to a given phenotype in clinically normal individuals; 2) this disruption can trigger phenotype independent, stereotypic, and amyloid-associated compensatory brain network changes indexed by changes in the default mode network; 3) amyloid deposition marks a saturation of functional compensation and portends an acceleration of the inciting phenotype specific, and tau-associated, network failure. With the advent of in~vivo molecular imaging of tau pathology, combined with amyloid and functional network imaging, it is now possible to investigate the relationship between functional brain networks, tau, and amyloid across the disease spectrum within these selectively vulnerable brain regions. In a large cohort (n~= 218) spanning the Alzheimer's disease spectrum from young, amyloid negative, cognitively normal subjects to Alzheimer's disease dementia, we found several distinct spatial patterns of tau deposition, including {\textquoteleft}Braak-like{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}non-Braak-like{\textquoteright}, across functionally related brain regions. Rather than arising focally and spreading sequentially, elevated tau signal seems to occur system-wide based on inferences made from multiple cross-sectional analyses we conducted looking at regional patterns of tau signal. Younger age-of-disease-onset was associated with {\textquoteleft}non-Braak-like{\textquoteright} patterns of tau, suggesting an association with atypical clinical phenotypes. As predicted by the cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease, we found that amyloid is a partial mediator of the relationship between functional network failure and tau deposition in functionally connected brain regions. This study implicates large-scale brain networks in the pathophysiology of tau deposition and offers support to models incorporating large-scale network physiology into disease models linking tau and amyloid, such as the cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease.},

Complex visual hallucinations (VH) are commonly a feature of disorders which affect temporal lobe structures, frequently in association with impairment of ascending monoaminergic pathways. When Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with VH, pathological changes characteristically affect the temporal lobes, a finding which is recapitulated by imaging findings. However, a major association of VH is with cognitive decline, and this is typically linked to deficits in attention and working memory, both of which are modulated by dopamine. Similarly, dopamine plays a crucial role in the function of prefrontal cortex, in addition to controlling access to consciousness via gating mechanisms that are dependent on the basal ganglia.},

	abstract = {Introduction Abnormalities on CT imaging may contribute to the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Recently, an expert consensus case definition (CCD) and set of imaging criteria for diagnosing basal meningeal enhancement (BME) have been proposed. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and reliability of these in a prospective cohort of adult meningitis patients. Methods Initial diagnoses were based on the CCD, classifying patients into: {\textquoteleft}Definite TBM{\textquoteright} (microbiological confirmation), {\textquoteleft}Probable TBM{\textquoteright} (diagnostic score >=10), {\textquoteleft}Possible TBM{\textquoteright} (diagnostic score 6{\textendash}9), {\textquoteleft}Not TBM{\textquoteright} (confirmation of an alternative diagnosis) or {\textquoteleft}Uncertain{\textquoteright} (diagnostic score of {\textless}6). CT images were evaluated independently on two occasions by four experienced reviewers. Intra-rater and inter-rater agreement were calculated using the kappa statistic. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated using both {\textquoteleft}Definite TBM{\textquoteright} and either {\textquoteleft}Definite TBM{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}Probable TBM{\textquoteright} as gold standards. Results CT scan criteria for BME had good intra-rater agreement ($\kappa$ range 0.35{\textendash}0.78) and fair to moderate inter-rater agreement ($\kappa$ range 0.20{\textendash}0.52). Intra- and inter-rater agreement on the CCD components were good to fair ($\kappa$ = ranges 0.47{\textendash}0.81 and 0.21{\textendash}0.63). Using {\textquoteleft}Definite TBM{\textquoteright} as a gold standard, the criteria for BME were very specific (61.5\%{\textendash}100\%), but insensitive (5.9\%{\textendash}29.4\%). Similarly, the imaging components of the CCD were highly specific (69.2{\textendash}100\%) but lacked sensitivity (0{\textendash}56.7\%). Similar values were found when using {\textquoteleft}Definite TBM{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}Probable TBM{\textquoteright} as a gold standard. Discussion The fair to moderate inter-rater agreement and poor sensitivities of the criteria for BME suggest that little reliance should be placed in these features in isolation. While the presence of the CCD criteria of acute infarction or tuberculoma(s) appears useful as rule-in criteria, their absence is of little help in excluding TBM. The CCD and criteria for BME, as well as any new criteria, need to be standardized and validated in prospective cohort studies.},

	abstract = {The 4-repeat (4R)-tauopathies can be clinically heterogeneous and difficult to diagnose. An FDG-PET pattern of hypometabolism has been previously reported in clinically suspected 4R-tauopathies. Considering that pathological confirmation has not been used as inclusion criteria in these studies, however, the possibility exists that atypical cases were excluded. We studied pathologically confirmed cases of 4R-tauopathies to determine if FDG-PET patterns of hypometabolism different than those previously described exist. We identified all autopsy confirmed 4R-tauopathies with FDG-PET imaging performed between 2010 and 2013 within the Mayo Clinic database. Clinical features and FDG-PET imaging were compared to a group of normal controls. Ten patients, seven of which had autopsy-confirmed progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), were identified. We also identified two cases with globular glial tauopathy (GGT) and one case of corticobasal degeneration (CBD). The overall predominant imaging findings included bilateral caudate hypometabolism in nine cases, mild asymmetric thalamic hypometabolism in eight, ~midbrain hypometabolism in seven, and bilateral hypometabolism in the supplementary motor area in seven. No differences were observed between PSP and GGT. The one CBD case had asymmetric parietal hypometabolism that was not seen in the PSP and GGT cases. As previously described, 4R-tauopathies are associated with frontal, caudate,~midbrain and thalamic hypometabolism on FDG-PET. This is the first report of FDG-PET in GGT, and although our series was limited, no features distinguish GGT from PSP. There was some evidence that parietal hypometabolism may be suggestive of CBD.},

	abstract = {Objectives To assess [18F]AV-1451 tau-PET (positron emission tomography) uptake patterns across the primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants (logopenic, semantic, and agrammatic), examine regional uptake patterns of [18F]AV-1451 independent of clinical diagnosis, and compare the diagnostic utility of [18F]AV-1451, [18F]-fluorodeoxygluclose (FDG)-PET and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to differentiate the PPA variants. Methods We performed statistical parametric mapping of [18F]AV-1451 across 40 PPA patients (logopenic-PPA = 14, semantic-PPA = 13, and agrammatic-PPA = 13) compared to 80 cognitively normal, Pittsburgh compound B{\textendash}negative controls, age and gender matched 2:1. Principal component analysis of regional [18F]AV-1451 tau-PET standard uptake value ratio was performed to understand underlying patterns of [18F]AV-1451 uptake independent of clinical diagnosis. Penalized multinomial regression analyses were utilized to assess diagnostic utility. Results Logopenic-PPA showed striking uptake throughout neocortex, particularly temporoparietal, compared to controls, semantic-PPA, and agrammatic-PPA. Semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA showed milder patterns of focal [18F]AV-1451 uptake. Semantic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left{\textgreater}right) in anteromedial temporal lobes, compared to controls and agrammatic-PPA. Agrammatic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left{\textgreater}right) throughout prefrontal white matter and in subcortical gray matter structures, compared to controls and semantic-PPA. The principal component analysis of regional [18F]AV-1451 indicated two primary dimensions, a severity dimension that distinguished logopenic-PPA from agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA, and a frontal versus temporal contrast that distinguishes agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA cases. Diagnostic utility of [18F]AV-1451was superior to MRI and at least equal to FDG-PET. Interpretation [18F]AV-1451binding characteristics differ across the PPA variants and were excellent at distinguishing between the variants. [18F]AV-1451binding characteristics were as good or better than other brain imaging modalities utilized in clinical practice, suggesting that [18F]AV-1451 may have clinical diagnostic utility in PPA.

In this study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of the new criteria with the National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy criteria at different times. Methods Patients with clinical parkinsonism, clinical and/or neuropathological diagnosis of PSP, were identified from the Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy brain bank. All patients had neuropathologic diagnoses and detailed clinical examination performed by a neurologist at 1 of the 3 Mayo Clinic sites, in Florida, Arizona, and Minnesota. Clinical symptoms and signs were abstracted retrospectively in a blinded fashion and used to determine whether patients met either diagnostic criterion. Patients were divided into early and late disease stage groups using a 3-year cutoff. Results A total of 129 patients were included, of whom 66 had PSP pathology (51\%). The remainder had other neurodegenerative diseases. The overall sensitivity of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society criteria was 87.9\%, compared with 45.5\% for the National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy criteria, whereas the specificity of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society probable PSP criteria was 85.7\%, compared with 90.5\% for the National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.

Recent clinical observations suggest two distinct subtypes of PPAOS may exist. Phonetic PPAOS is characterized predominantly by distorted sound substitutions. Prosodic PPAOS is characterized predominantly by slow, segmented speech. Demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging data (MRI, DTI, and FDG-PET) were analyzed to validate these subtypes and explore anatomic correlates. The Phonetic subtype demonstrated bilateral involvement of the SMA, precentral gyrus, and cerebellar crus. The Prosodic subtype demonstrated more focal involvement in the SMA and right superior cerebellar peduncle.

	abstract = {Background
Some patients with progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS) demonstrate a focal area of midbrain hypometabolism on FDG-PET scans which we call the {\textquoteleft}pimple sign{\textquoteright}. We assessed its association with midbrain atrophy, its reliability and its ability to differentiate PSPS from corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).
Methods
We identified 67 patients with PSPS, CBS or MSA who had volumetric MRI as well as FDG-PET imaging. Midbrain volume was measured and expressed as a percentage of total intracranial volume. Two independent, blinded specialists rated the {\textquoteleft}pimple sign{\textquoteright} on FDG-PET as {\textquoteleft}absent{\textquoteright}, {\textquoteleft}possible{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}definite{\textquoteright}. Midbrain volumes were compared across these groups and reliability assessed with the kappa statistic. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using CBS and MSA patients as controls.
Results
Midbrain volume was decreased in the {\textquoteleft}definite{\textquoteright} group compared to the {\textquoteleft}absent{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}possible{\textquoteright} groups (p~=~0.0036). Inter-rater reliability for the pimple sign was high ($\kappa$~=~0.90). A {\textquoteleft}definite pimple sign{\textquoteright} had a high specificity (100\%) but low sensitivity (29\%) for PSPS, whilst the presence of a possible or definite sign had a sensitivity of 79\%.
Conclusion
The {\textquoteleft}pimple sign{\textquoteright} of PSPS is associated with midbrain atrophy, and may be helpful in differentiating PSPS from CBS and MSA.},

              To describe the prevalence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and determine the association between CMBs and $\beta$-amyloid burden on PET.
            
            
              Methods
              
                From the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, 1,215 participants (53\% male) underwent 3-tesla MRI scans with T2* gradient recalled echo sequences from October 2011 to February 2017. A total of 1,123 participants (92\%) underwent
                11
                C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET scans. The prevalence of CMBs was derived by adjusting for nonparticipation and standardizing to the Olmsted County, MN, population. The relationship between $\beta$-amyloid burden and CMB presence and location was tested using logistic regression models. Ordinal logistic models tested the relationship between CMB frequency and $\beta$-amyloid burden.
              
            
            
              Results
              Two hundred seventy-four participants (22.6\%) had at least one CMB. CMB frequency increased with age by decade (11\% aged 60{\textendash}69 years, 22\% 70{\textendash}79 years, and 39\% 80 years and older). After adjusting for age, sex, and hypertension, PiB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was associated with increased odds of a CMB. The association between PiB SUVR and CMBs was location-specific; PiB SUVR was associated with lobar CMBs but not deep CMBs. Age, hypertension, and PiB SUVR were associated with increasing CMB count. CMB density was greatest in parietal and occipital regions; $\beta$-amyloid burden correlated with concentration of CMBs in all lobar regions. Among participants with multiple CMBs, greater PiB uptake occurred in the pre- and postcentral gyri superiorly, the superior parietal lobe and precuneus, the angular gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and temporal poles.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The prevalence of CMBs increases with age. In this population-based sample, $\beta$-amyloid load was associated with lobar but not with deep CMBs.},

	abstract = {Background
Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is an important and treatable cause of neurologic impairment. Diagnosis is complicated due to symptoms overlapping with other age related disorders. The pathophysiology underlying iNPH is not well understood. We explored FDG-PET abnormalities in iNPH patients in order to determine if FDG-PET may serve as a biomarker to differentiate iNPH from common neurodegenerative disorders.
Methods
We retrospectively compared 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging patterns from seven iNPH patients (mean age 74 {\textpm} 6 years) to age and sex matched controls, as well as patients diagnosed with clinical Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD), and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Partial volume corrected and uncorrected images were reviewed separately.
Results
Patients with iNPH, when compared to controls, AD, DLB/PDD, and bvFTD, had significant regional hypometabolism in the dorsal striatum, involving the caudate and putamen bilaterally. These results remained highly significant after partial volume correction.
Conclusions
In this study, we report a FDG-PET pattern of hypometabolism in iNPH involving the caudate and putamen with preserved cortical metabolism. This pattern may differentiate iNPH from degenerative diseases and has the potential to serve as a biomarker for iNPH in future studies. These findings also further our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the iNPH clinical presentation.},

	abstract = {Background Elevated uptake of the [18F]AV-1451 tau-PET ligand has been observed cross-sectionally in subjects with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). However, it is unknown how the ligand performs longitudinally in PSP. We aimed to determine how regional measures of change on [18F]AV-1451 PET perform as longitudinal biomarkers of PSP compared with the more established biomarker of rate of midbrain atrophy. Methods Sixteen subjects with PSP underwent 2 serial [18F]AV-1451 tau-PET scans and 3-Tesla MRI over 12 months and were age- and sex-matched to 39 healthy controls with longitudinal [18F]AV-1451 PET. Median [18F]AV-1451 uptake was calculated for each scan for regions of interest across the brain and divided by uptake in cerebellar crus to create standard uptake value ratios. Midbrain volume on MRI was also calculated for each scan. Sample sizes required to power placebo-controlled treatment trials were calculated. Results Rate of midbrain atrophy was significantly increased in PSP compared with controls. [18F]AV-1451 regional change measures were significantly increased in PSP compared with controls in the pallidum, precentral cortex, dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, and midbrain. Change over time in the PSP Rating Scale correlated with change in midbrain volume but did not correlate with change in the [18F]AV-1451 measures. Smallest sample-size estimates were obtained with rate of midbrain atrophy, followed by the PSP Rating Scale, with both outperforming [18F]AV-1451 measures. Conclusions [18F]AV-1451 tau-PET measures increase over time in subjects with PSP, but longitudinal [18F]AV-1451 measures may not perform as well as rate of midbrain atrophy as biomarkers for PSP clinical trials. {\textcopyright} 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

              To describe the phenomenon of tau-negative amnestic dementia mimicking Alzheimer disease (AD) clinically and radiologically and to highlight the importance of biomarkers in AD research.
            
            
              Methods
              Eight participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia were evaluated by a behavioral neurologist and had a standardized neuropsychological battery performed. All participants completed structural (MRI) and molecular (amyloid and tau PET) imaging. AD-signature thickness and adjusted hippocampal volume served as structural biomarkers, while standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from validated regions of interest for amyloid and tau PET were used to determine molecular biomarker status.
            
            
              Results
              All participants were thought to have AD as the primary driver of their symptoms before any PET imaging. All participants had hippocampal atrophy, and 2 participants fell below the AD-signature thickness cutoff for elderly controls (2.57), with a further 3 falling below the more stringent cutoff based on young controls (2.67). Four participants were amyloid positive (SUVR {\textgreater}1.42), and all were tau negative (SUVR {\textless}1.33).
            
            
              Conclusions
              The participants presented here were clinically impaired, with structural imaging evidence of neurodegeneration, in the absence of any significant tau accumulation. Therefore, AD is unlikely as a cause of their clinical presentation and neurodegenerative imaging findings. Several implications are discussed, including the need to establish amyloid and tau positivity in N+ participants before enrolling them in trials of disease-modifying therapy agents for AD.},

	abstract = {Apraxia of speech is a motor speech disorder thought to result from impaired planning or programming of articulatory movements. It can be the initial or only manifestation of a degenerative disease, termed primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS). The aim of this study was to use task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess large-scale brain network pathophysiology in PPAOS. Twenty-two PPAOS participants were identified from a prospective cohort of degenerative speech and language disorders patients. All participants had a comprehensive, standardized evaluation including an evaluation by a speech-language pathologist, examination by a behavioral neurologist and a multimodal imaging protocol which included a task-free fMRI sequence. PPAOS participants were age and sex matched to amyloid-negative, cognitively normal participants with a 1:2 ratio. We chose a set of hypothesis driven, predefined intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from a large, out of sample independent component analysis and then used them to initialize a spatiotemporal dual regression to estimate participant level connectivity within these ICNs. Specifically, we evaluated connectivity within the speech and language, face and hand sensorimotor, left working memory, salience, superior parietal, supramarginal, insular and deep gray ICNs in a multivariate manner. The spatial maps for each ICN were then compared between PPAOS and control participants. We used clinical measures of apraxia of speech severity to assess for clinical-connectivity correlations for regions found to differ between PPAOS and control participants. Compared to controls, PPAOS participants had reduced connectivity of the right supplementary motor area and left posterior temporal gyrus to the rest of the speech and language ICN. The connectivity of the right supplementary motor area correlated negatively with an articulatory error score. PPAOS participants also had reduced connectivity of the left supplementary motor area to the face sensorimotor ICN, between the left lateral prefrontal cortex and the salience ICN and between the left temporal-occipital junction and the left working memory ICN. The latter connectivity correlated with the apraxia of speech severity rating scale, although the finding did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Increased connectivity was noted in PPAOS participants between the dorsal posterior cingulate and the left working memory ICN. Our results support the importance of the supplementary motor area in the pathophysiology of PPAOS, which appears to be disconnected from speech and language regions. Supplementary motor area connectivity may serve as a biomarker of degenerative apraxia of speech severity.},

When agPPA includes AOS, a tauopathy is the likely underlying pathology. Recently, [18F]AV-1451 was developed for the in-vivo assessment of tau. In this study, we compared patterns of tau tracer uptake in patients with agPPA with and without AOS. Methods Nine patients with agPPA (four without AOS) underwent tau positron emission tomography imaging with [18F]AV-1451. Uptake of [18F]AV-1451 was assessed as cortical to cerebellar crus ratio (standard uptake value ratio) in cortical regions of interest measured using the MCALT atlas and compared voxel-wise in SPM12. Each patient was age- and sex-matched to three controls. Results The agPPA without AOS showed uptake in the left frontal and temporal lobes, whereas agPPA with AOS showed uptake in the bilateral supplementary motor areas, frontal lobes, precuneus and precentral gyrus relative to controls. The left precentral gyrus had uptake in agPPA with AOS relative to those without AOS. Conclusions This cross-sectional study suggests that [18F]AV-1451 uptake in the precentral gyrus is implicated in AOS in agPPA.},

The maximum allocation extinction rules were developed to provide a consistent method for applying the criteria and reaching a single diagnostic label. In this study, we apply both to a neuropathologic cohort of progressive supranuclear palsy and other parkinsonian conditions. Methods An autopsy cohort of 54 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and 56 patients with other neuropathologic diseases was selected. Clinical data were retrospectively abstracted, and the diagnostic criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy were applied. All possible phenotypes applicable were listed and maximum allocation extinction rules were applied to assess reduction in the number of phenotypes ascribed per patient. Results In the progressive supranuclear palsy group, 52 patients met the criteria for multiple phenotypes, with an average of 7 phenotypes per patient. In the nonprogressive supranuclear palsy group, all 56 patients had features of more than one phenotype, up to 3 per patient. After application of maximum allocation extinction rules, the majority of the patients in both groups had a single predominant phenotype. Freezing of gait, supranuclear gaze palsy, and frontal behavioral syndrome were more common in the progressive supranuclear palsy group. Conclusions The diagnostic criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy identify many clinical features, thereby leading to assignment of multiple phenotypes per patient. We demonstrate that the maximum allocation extinction rules can effectively lead to a single consensus phenotype, maintaining a uniform diagnostic label for clinical and research applications.},

The acquisition of such discourse is often not assessed, resulting in inconsistency between the levels used among students of similar academic backgrounds. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which appropriate discourse was adopted by 9 medical students early in their final year during clinical case presentations, and to compare this usage with the students{\textquoteright} final results. Methods: Transcriptions of recorded case presentations by 9 students were assessed by 2 experts and a peer evaluator, using a rubric which drew on prior research in medical discourse, and included the prominent themes of terminology and thematic staging. These were then compared with their academic results. Results: Our findings show that most students are able to use the appropriate terminology when they reach their final year of study. However, our data also support the hypothesis that students with similar academic backgrounds may display considerable variation in their level of discourse. Although it appears as if the students were all beginning to shift towards a more mature form of medical discourse, the degree to which this occurs is sporadic. The apparent absence of a relationship between discursive competencies and academic achievement may suggest that the ability of assessment to encourage the adoption of disciplinary discourse is perhaps not being optimally applied, although further research is required.},

Objectives To evaluate the clinical criteria in a cohort of speech/language patients with longitudinal follow-up. Methods A total of 52 patients presenting with progressive apraxia of speech and/or agrammatic aphasia were followed longitudinally for up to 6 visits with clinical assessments and magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed oculomotor, postural instability, and akinesia diagnostic levels and determined whether patients met criteria for possible PSP-speech/language or probable PSP at each visit. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed time-to-event probabilities according to age. Statistical parametric mapping and midbrain volume were assessed according to disease progression. Results Few PSP symptoms were observed early in the disease, with oculomotor abnormalities and falls first observed 2 years after onset. Falls were more common than vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. Bradykinesia and rigidity commonly developed but axial was rarely greater than appendicular rigidity. During follow-up, 54\% met criteria for possible PSP-speech/language, 38\% for probable PSP-Richardson's syndrome, and 38\% for probable PSP-parkinsonism, most commonly 6 to 6.9 years after onset. The probability of developing PSP was greater when onset was at an age older than 70 years. Patients who progressed to probable PSP had more parkinsonism and oculomotor impairment at baseline and greater midbrain atrophy when compared with those who did not develop probable PSP. Conclusions Symptoms typical of PSP commonly develop in patients presenting with a progressive speech/language disorder. Older age appears to be an important prognostic factor in these patients.},

However, little is known about how these processes relate to each other. The aim of this study was to investigate multimodal associations between flortaucipir PET uptake, tissue volume loss on structural MRI and white matter tract disruption on DTI. Thirty-four patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and 29 normal controls underwent flortaucipir PET, MRI and DTI. Voxel-wise comparison was performed between patients and controls. Sparse canonical correlations analysis was applied on regional measurements of flortaucipir uptake, tissue volume, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of the PSP population. Pearson's correlation coefficients were assessed across modalities on the regions identified by the sparse canonical correlation analyses. Sparse canonical correlation analyses identified associations between elevated flortaucipir uptake in the cerebellar dentate, red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus and decreased volume in the same regions, and decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in tracts including the superior cerebellar peduncle, sagittal striatum and posterior corona radiata. Furthermore, decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in the body of the corpus callosum and anterior and superior corona radiata were related to volume loss in the frontal lobe. Tau uptake measured by flortaucipir PET appears to be related to the neurodegenerative process of progressive supranuclear palsy, including reduced tissue volume and white matter tract degeneration.},

	abstract = {Purpose
      The primary aim was to examine the utility of the Western Aphasia Battery{\textendash}Revised
         (WAB-R; Kertesz, 2007) for classifying variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Traditional WAB-R
         metrics of Aphasia Quotient (AQ), subtest scores, WAB-R classification, and several
         novel metrics were examined. A secondary aim was to examine these same WAB-R metrics
         in individuals with primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS).
      
      Method
      A retrospective analysis of WAB-R records from 169 participants enrolled in a study
         of neurodegenerative speech and language disorders was conducted. PPA/PPAOS classification
         was determined by consensus review of speech, language, and cognitive profiles. Scores
         on each of the WAB-R subtests were obtained to derive AQ, WAB-R aphasia profile, and
         3 ratios reflecting relative performance on subtests.
      
      Results
      Mean AQ was significantly higher in the PPAOS group compared to all PPA variants except
         primary fluent aphasia. AQ above the normal cutoff was observed for 20\% of participants
         with PPA. Significant main effects of group were noted for each of the subtests. Follow-up
         comparisons most frequently discriminated PPAOS, primary agrammatic aphasia (PAA),
         and logopenic progressive aphasia. Primary fluent aphasia and semantic dementia (SD)
         subtest scores were less distinctive, with the exception of Naming for SD, which was
         significantly lower than for PAA and PPAOS. When the WAB-R AQ detected aphasia, a
         classification of anomic aphasia was most frequently observed; this pattern held true
         for each of the PPA variants. The mean Information Content:Naming ratio was highest
         for SD, and the mean Comprehension:Fluency ratio was highest for PAA.
      
      Conclusions
      In the current study, AQ underestimated the presence of PPA and WAB-R classification
         did not distinguish among PPA classification determined by consensus. Performance
         on individual subtests and relative performance across subtests demonstrated inconsistent
         alignment with PPA classification. We conclude the WAB-R in isolation is inadequate
         to detect or characterize PPA. We instead suggest utilizing the WAB-R as 1 component
         of a comprehensive language and motor speech assessment when PPA is suspected.},

	abstract = {Objective
To compare the Short Test of Mental Status (STMS) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for predicting and detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Participants and Methods
Participants from the community-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) (November 24, 2010, through May 19, 2012) and an academic referral Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s Disease Research Center (ADRC) (March 16, 2015, through September 5, 2018) were analyzed. All participants were evaluated using a standardized neuropsychological battery, and a multidisciplinary consensus diagnosis was assigned. The MCSA and ADRC samples included 313 and 106 stable cognitively normal (CN) participants, 72 and 8 CN participants at baseline who developed incident MCI or dementia, 114 and 96 participants with prevalent MCI, and 25 and 132 participants with dementia, respectively.
Results
There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 tests in 6 of 7 diagnostic comparisons across academic referral and community populations. The STMS had a better area under the curve (0.90; 95\% CI, 0.87-0.93) for differentiating prevalent MCI from CN participants in the MCSA cohort compared with the MoCA cohort (0.85; 95\% CI, 0.81-0.89; P=.01). In addition, 53\% of the stable CN participants (222 of 419) scored less than 26 on the MoCA, with specificity of 47\% for diagnosing prevalent MCI.
Conclusion
We provide evidence that the STMS performs similarly to the MoCA in a variety of settings and neurodegenerative syndromes. These results suggest that the current recommended MoCA cutoff score may be overly sensitive, consistent with previous studies. We also provide a conversion table for comparing the 2 cognitive tests.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy that is associated with different clinical variants, including PSP-Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS), PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P), PSP-corticobasal syndrome (PSP-CBS), PSP-frontal (PSP-F), PSP-progressive gait freezing (PSP-PGF) and PSP-speech/language (PSP-SL). While PSP-RS has been well-characterized on neuroimaging, the characteristics of the other atypical variants are less well defined and it is unknown how they compare to each other or relate to neuropathology. We aimed to assess and compare regional atrophy on MRI and [18F]flortaucipir uptake on PET across PSP variants.
Materials and methods
105 PSP patients (53 PSP-RS, 23 PSP-SL, 12 PSP-P, 8 PSP-CBS, 5 PSP-F and 4 PSP-PGF) underwent volumetric MRI, with 59 of these also undergoing flortaucipir PET. Voxel-level and region-level analyses were performed comparing PSP variants to 30 controls and to each other. Semi-quantitative tau burden measurements were also performed in 21 patients with autopsy-confirmed PSP.
Results
All variants showed evidence for atrophy or increased flortaucipir uptake in striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus. Superior cerebellar peduncle volume loss was only observed in PSP-RS, PSP-CBS and PSP-F. Volume loss in the frontal lobes was observed in PSP-SL, PSP-CBS and PSP-F, with these variants also showing highest cortical tau burden at autopsy. The PSP-P and PSP-PGF variants showed more restricted patterns of neurodegeneration predominantly involving striatum, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and thalamus. The PSP-SL variant showed greater volume loss and flortaucipir uptake in supplementary motor area and motor cortex compared to all other variants, but showed less involvement of subthalamic nucleus and midbrain. Compared to PSP-RS, PSP-P had larger midbrain volume and greater flortaucipir uptake in putamen.
Conclusion
The PSP variants have different patterns of involvement of subcortical circuitry, perhaps suggesting different patterns of disease spread through the brain. These findings will be important in the development of appropriate neuroimaging biomarkers for the different PSP variants.},

	abstract = {Primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) is a term used to describe a neurodegenerative condition in which apraxia of speech (AOS; a planning and/or programming deficit) occurs in the absence of aphasia (a language deficit). PPAOS is strongly associated with 4-repeat tau pathology. Elevated flortaucipir ([18F]AV-1451; FTP) uptake has been observed cross-sectionally in patients with PPAOS and those with aphasia. Here, we evaluated longitudinal changes in previously-identified regions of uptake and their relationship with clinical presentation. Thirteen patients who were diagnosed with PPAOS (5 female) at presentation underwent FTP PET imaging at two visits (mean 1 year interval). Median age was 72, with a median of 4 years disease duration at initial testing. Beta-amyloid status was assessed with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), where a global PiB ratio{\textgreater}1.48 was deemed amyloid positive (n~=~4). FTP uptake was assessed as cortical to cerebellar crus ratios (SUVr) in cortical regions of interest. A single hierarchical linear model (HLM) compared PPAOS patients to 52 cognitively unimpaired controls of similar age and sex. Annualized SUVr change was the outcome, predicted by region, clinical status, and age. Person-specific effects accounted for intra-patient correlations and contralateral regions were included as repeated measures. Changes in clinical measures were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; statistically significant changes in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MDS-UPDRS, motor section, and PSP Rating Scale were noted between visits. Changes in FTP SUVr were greater for patients than controls. The strongest changes in PPAOS patients were in the precentral gyrus, pallidum, and mid and superior frontal gyri, per the HLM. Qualitatively, larger changes were seen in patients who had developed aphasia by the time of their baseline scan (n~=~5). While the biological mechanisms of FTP signal in non-AD tauopathies are unknown, this study demonstrates the utility of FTP in tracking disease progression in 4R tauopathies.},

                gene were imaged with 3T MRI, PiB-PET, and tau-PET in their fourth decade of life.
              
            
            
              Results
              There was significant neocortical uptake of the tau-PET tracer in all 4 familial prion cases. However, PiB-PET images did not demonstrate abnormally elevated signal in neocortical or cerebellar regions for any of the patients.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                In vivo detection of molecular hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases will be a prerequisite to well-conducted therapeutic trials. Understanding the in vivo behavior of these PET biomarkers in the setting of various neurodegenerative processes is imperative to their proper use in such trials and for research studies focused on the basic neurobiology of neurodegeneration. This study supports the high specificity of neocortical

	abstract = {In recent years a large and growing body of research has greatly advanced our understanding of primary progressive apraxia of speech. Handedness has emerged as one potential marker of selective vulnerability in degenerative diseases. This study evaluated the clinical and imaging findings in non-right handed compared to right handed participants in a prospective cohort diagnosed with primary progressive apraxia of speech. A total of 30 participants were included. Compared to the expected rate in the population, there was a higher prevalence of non-right handedness among those with primary progressive apraxia of speech (6/30, 20\%). Small group numbers meant that these results did not reach statistical significance, although the effect sizes were moderate-to-large. There were no clinical differences between right handed and non-right handed participants. Bilateral hypometabolism was seen in primary progressive apraxia of speech compared to controls, with non-right handed participants showing more right hemispheric involvement. This is the first report of a higher rate of non-right handedness in participants with isolated apraxia of speech, which may point to an increased vulnerability for developing this disorder among non-right handed participants. This challenges prior hypotheses about a relative protective effect of non-right handedness for tau-related neurodegeneration. We discuss potential avenues for future research to investigate the relationship between handedness and motor disorders more generally.},

              Objective:
              To compare survival among patients with different combinations of apraxia of speech (AOS) and agrammatic aphasia, including those with isolated AOS (primary progressive apraxia of speech, PPAOS), both AOS and agrammatic aphasia (AOS+PAA) and isolated agrammatic aphasia (progressive agrammatic aphasia, PAA).
            
            
              Methods:
              One-hundred-and-nine patients were recruited who had any combination of AOS and agrammatic aphasia (42 PPAOS, 56 AOS+PAA and 11 PAA) and were followed longitudinally, with 57 patients having since died. Cox proportional hazards models were used to quantify the relative risk of death across diagnoses. Adjusted survival curves are presented based on this model. We also assessed the influence of AOS and aphasia severity on survival.
            
            
              Results:
              PPAOS had the longest survival (median survival of 5.97 years from baseline visit), followed by PAA (5.26 years) and then AOS+PAA (4.33 years). AOS+PAA had a greater risk of death than PPAOS, with a hazard ratio of 3.01 (Lower/upper CI= 1.66/5.46, p{\textless}0.001). Risk of death did not differ between PAA and the other groups. All results accounted for age and time from onset to baseline visit. AOS severity, independent of syndromic diagnosis, was associated with greater risk of death, with a hazard ratio of 1.35 for a one-point increase in severity. Aphasia severity was not associated with risk of death.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Individuals with PPAOS have better survival and reduced risk of death compared to AOS+PAA individuals. This finding will help improve prognostic estimates for these patients and supports the value of distinguishing PPAOS from AOS+PAA.},

	abstract = {Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is the most common Parkinson-Plus syndrome and is associated with early onset of dysphagia relative to Parkinson Disease. The current study contributes to the growing understanding of swallowing dysfunction in PSP by describing oropharyngeal swallowing characteristics in a large prospective cohort of participants with PSP employing a nationally standardized videofluoroscopy protocol and a disease severity scale developed expressly for PSP. Participants were 51 adults diagnosed with PSP. Each participant underwent a clinical interview and standardized videofluorographic assessment. Swallowing function was characterized with the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Scale (MBSImP) and Penetration{\textendash}Aspiration Scale (PAS). Variables of interest were participant-reported difficulties with liquids and/or solids; overall impression score for each of the 17 individual MBSImP components, as well as Oral Total Sum and Pharyngeal Total Sum; and PAS. Data were described with median interquartile range, counts, and proportions. Spearman{\textquoteright}s rank correlations were calculated between MBSImP scores and participant-reported indices, FOIS, and PSP Rating Scale. Approximately two-thirds of participants reported difficulties with liquids, solids, or both, although fewer than 15\% reported modifying consistencies. Videofluorographic findings included predominant oral phase impairments, including back and forth rocking motion of the tongue, delayed initiation of the pharyngeal swallow, and oral residue. Pharyngeal phase impairments were relatively infrequent and comparatively mild, with the exception of reduced tongue base retraction contributing to pharyngeal residue, and mildly disrupted laryngeal vestibule closure. Disease severity correlated significantly with oral (r = .0.42, p = .0.002) and pharyngeal (r = 0.41, p = .0.003) total sum scores as well as with the oral phase components of oral transport (r = .0.33, p = .0.02) and initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (r = .0.38, p = .0.007), and PAS for thin liquids (r = .0.44, p = .0.001). The PSP Rating Scale was not more strongly correlated with swallowing impairment than has been reported for other disease severity rating scales. Dysphagia is a common complaint of patients with PSP. The current findings corroborate and expand upon those reported in the literature, detailing relatively more frequent and more severe oral phase impairments and relatively spared hyolaryngeal excursion. Further research is needed to characterize the progression of dysphagia in PSP and to determine whether dysphagia varies in character or in rate of progression across variants of PSP.},

              To evaluate FDG-PET as an antemortem diagnostic tool for Alzheimer-related TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a cross-sectional neuroimaging{\textendash}histologic analysis of patients with antemortem FDG-PET and postmortem brain tissue from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Study of Aging with Alzheimer spectrum pathology. TDP-43-positive status was assigned when TDP-43-immunoreactive inclusions were identified in the amygdala. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analyses compared TDP-43-positive (TDP-43[+]) with TDP-43-negative cases (TDP-43[-]), correcting for field strength, sex, Braak neurofibrillary tangle, and neuritic plaque stages. Cross-validated logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether regional FDG-PET values predict TDP-43 status. We also assessed the ratio of inferior temporal to medial temporal (IMT) metabolism as this was proposed as a biomarker of hippocampal sclerosis.
            
            
              Results
              
                Of 73 cases, 27 (37\%) were TDP-43(+), of which 6 (8\%) had hippocampal sclerosis. SPM analysis showed TDP-43(+) cases having greater hypometabolism of medial temporal, frontal superior medial, and frontal supraorbital (FSO) regions (

                {\textless} 0.001). An IMT/FSO ratio was superior to the IMT in discriminating TDP-43(+) cases: 78\% vs 48\%, respectively.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Alzheimer-related TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with hypometabolism in the medial temporal and frontal regions. Combining FDG-PET measures from these regions may be useful for antemortem prediction of Alzheimer-related TDP-43 proteinopathy.
            
            
              Classification of evidence
              This study provides Class II evidence that hypometabolism in the medial temporal and frontal regions on FDG-PET is associated with Alzheimer-related TDP-43 proteinopathy.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) is a neurodegenerative syndrome in which patients present with an isolated motor speech disorder. Some PPAOS patients develop parkinsonism and other features of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and/or corticobasal syndrome (CBS) over time. We aimed to assess the evolution of parkinsonian characteristics in PPAOS patients who had been followed yearly for at least six years.
METHODS: From a large cohort of 46 PPAOS patients, eight were followed yearly for {\textgreater} 6-years in multiple NIH-funded grants. Parkinsonian and other features, including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, postural instability, apraxia, ocular motor function and cognition were assessed at each visit, and research criteria applied for PSP and CBS diagnosis. Neurological, speech-language test scores, and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) and MRI midbrain volumes were assessed.
RESULTS: A Parkinson's plus syndrome developed in all eight patients (100\%). Bradykinesia was the earliest feature, followed by rigidity and postural instability. Tremor was not a significant feature. Parkinsonism, limb apraxia and ocular motor impairment tended to develop four-to-five years after onset with some patients having slight asymmetric parkinsonism. Six patients (75\%) met research criteria for probable PSP, although only one for PSP-Richardson's syndrome; three patients met criteria for possible CBS. Slightly asymmetric, left-sided, hypometabolism was observed on FDG-PET, not matching asymmetry of Parkinsonism. Midbrain hypometabolism was absent-minimal. Three patients had progressive midbrain volumes in the PSP-Richardson's syndrome range.
CONCLUSIONS: A Parkinson's plus syndrome may inevitably develop in PPAOS supporting PPAOS as an early presentation of a Parkinson's plus disorder.},

	abstract = {Altered iron metabolism has been hypothesized to be associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology, and prior work has shown associations between iron load and beta amyloid plaques. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a recently popularized MR technique to infer local tissue susceptibility secondary to the presence of iron as well as other minerals. Greater QSM values imply greater iron concentration in tissue. QSM has been used to study relationships between cerebral iron load and established markers of Alzheimer's disease, however relationships remain unclear. In this work we study QSM signal characteristics and associations between susceptibility measured on QSM and established clinical and imaging markers of Alzheimer's disease. The study included 421 participants (234 male, median age 70 years, range 34-97 years) from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center; 296 (70\%) had a diagnosis of cognitively unimpaired, 69 (16\%) mild cognitive impairment, and 56 (13\%) amnestic dementia. All participants had multi-echo gradient recalled echo imaging, PiB amyloid PET, and Tauvid tau PET. Variance components analysis showed that variation in cortical susceptibility across participants was low. Linear regression models were fit to assess associations with regional susceptibility. Expected increases in susceptibility were found with older age and cognitive impairment in the deep and inferior gray nuclei (pallidum, putamen, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus) (betas: 0.0017 to 0.0053 ppm for a 10 year increase in age, p=0.03 to {\textless}0.001; betas: 0.0021 to 0.0058 ppm for a 5 point decrease in Short Test of Mental Status, p=0.003 to p{\textless}0.001). Effect sizes in cortical regions were smaller, and the age associations were generally negative. Higher susceptibility was significantly associated with higher amyloid PET SUVR in the pallidum and putamen (betas: 0.0029 and 0.0012 ppm for a 20\% increase in amyloid PET, p=0.05 and 0.02, respectively), higher tau PET in the basal ganglia with the largest effect size in the pallidum (0.0082 ppm for a 20\% increase in tau PET, p{\textless}0.001), and with lower cortical gray matter volume in the medial temporal lobe (0.0006 ppm for a 20\% decrease in volume, p=0.03). Overall, these findings suggest that susceptibility in the deep and inferior gray nuclei, particularly the pallidum and putamen, may be a marker of cognitive decline, amyloid deposition, and off-target binding of the tau ligand. Although iron has been demonstrated in amyloid plaques and in association with neurodegeneration, it is of insufficient quantity to be reliably detected in the cortex using this implementation of QSM.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between tau and amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) molecular positron emission tomography (PET) and both Alzheimer-related pathology and 4-repeat tau pathology in autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).
METHODS: Twenty-four patients had [18 F]-flortaucipir-PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], n = 10; corticobasal degeneration [CBD], n = 10; FTLD-TDP, n = 3; and Pick disease, n = 1). All but 1 had Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET. Braak staging, A$\beta$ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts, and semiquantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta region of interest (meta-ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in 1 PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden.
RESULTS: Nine cases (37.5\%) had A$\beta$ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with A$\beta$ plaque count, with 100\% specificity and 50\% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty-one (87.5\%) had Braak stages I to IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta-ROI SUVRs were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age-related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.
INTERPRETATION: Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer-related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild Alzheimer pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP. ANN NEUROL 2020.},
