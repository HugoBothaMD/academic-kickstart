	abstract = {Disruption of mental functions in Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD) and related disorders is accompanied by selective degeneration of brain regions for unknown reasons. These regions comprise large-scale ensembles of cells organized into networks required for mental functioning. A mechanistic framework does not exist to explain the relationship between clinical symptoms of dementia, patterns of neurodegeneration, and the functional connectome. The association between dementia symptoms and degenerative brain anatomy encodes a mapping between mental functions and neuroanatomy. We isolated this mapping through unsupervised decoding of neurodegeneration in humans. This reflected a simple information processing-based functional description of macroscale brain anatomy, the global functional state space (GFSS). We then linked the GFSS to AD physiology, functional networks, and mental abilities. We extended the GFSS framework to normal aging and seven degenerative diseases of mental functions.One Sentence Summary A global information processing framework for mental functions links neuroanatomy, cognitive neuroscience and clinical neurology.Competing Interest StatementD.J. is an inventor on a patent application describing machine learning techniques for automated clinical readings of medical images.Funding StatementThis work was funded in part by NIH grants R01 AG011378 (C.J.), R01 AG041851 (C.J.), P50 AG016574 (R.P.), U01 AG06786 (R.P.), and by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Elsie and Marvin Dekelboum Family Foundation, The Liston Family Foundation, the Robert H. and Clarice Smith and Abigail van Buren Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s Disease Research Program, The GHR Foundation, Foundation Dr. Corinne Schuler (Geneva, Switzerland), Race Against Dementia, and the Mayo Foundation.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All participants or their designee provided written consent with approval of the Mayo Clinic Foundation and Olmsted Medical Center Institutional Review boards.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
