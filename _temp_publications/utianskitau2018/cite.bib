  abstract = {Background and purpose The non-fluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (agPPA) is a heterogeneous diagnosis wherein some individuals have apraxia of speech (AOS). When agPPA includes AOS, a tauopathy is the likely underlying pathology. Recently, [18F]AV-1451 was developed for the in-vivo assessment of tau. In this study, we compared patterns of tau tracer uptake in patients with agPPA with and without AOS. Methods Nine patients with agPPA (four without AOS) underwent tau positron emission tomography imaging with [18F]AV-1451. Uptake of [18F]AV-1451 was assessed as cortical to cerebellar crus ratio (standard uptake value ratio) in cortical regions of interest measured using the MCALT atlas and compared voxel-wise in SPM12. Each patient was age- and sex-matched to three controls. Results The agPPA without AOS showed uptake in the left frontal and temporal lobes, whereas agPPA with AOS showed uptake in the bilateral supplementary motor areas, frontal lobes, precuneus and precentral gyrus relative to controls. The left precentral gyrus had uptake in agPPA with AOS relative to those without AOS. Conclusions This cross-sectional study suggests that [18F]AV-1451 uptake in the precentral gyrus is implicated in AOS in agPPA.},
