  abstract = {Introduction Abnormalities on CT imaging may contribute to the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Recently, an expert consensus case definition (CCD) and set of imaging criteria for diagnosing basal meningeal enhancement (BME) have been proposed. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and reliability of these in a prospective cohort of adult meningitis patients. Methods Initial diagnoses were based on the CCD, classifying patients into: \textquoteleftDefinite TBM\textquoteright (microbiological confirmation), \textquoteleftProbable TBM\textquoteright (diagnostic score >=10), \textquoteleftPossible TBM\textquoteright (diagnostic score 6\textendash9), \textquoteleftNot TBM\textquoteright (confirmation of an alternative diagnosis) or \textquoteleftUncertain\textquoteright (diagnostic score of \textless6). CT images were evaluated independently on two occasions by four experienced reviewers. Intra-rater and inter-rater agreement were calculated using the kappa statistic. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated using both \textquoteleftDefinite TBM\textquoteright and either \textquoteleftDefinite TBM\textquoteright or \textquoteleftProbable TBM\textquoteright as gold standards. Results CT scan criteria for BME had good intra-rater agreement ($\kappa$ range 0.35\textendash0.78) and fair to moderate inter-rater agreement ($\kappa$ range 0.20\textendash0.52). Intra- and inter-rater agreement on the CCD components were good to fair ($\kappa$ = ranges 0.47\textendash0.81 and 0.21\textendash0.63). Using \textquoteleftDefinite TBM\textquoteright as a gold standard, the criteria for BME were very specific (61.5%\textendash100%), but insensitive (5.9%\textendash29.4%). Similarly, the imaging components of the CCD were highly specific (69.2\textendash100%) but lacked sensitivity (0\textendash56.7%). Similar values were found when using \textquoteleftDefinite TBM\textquoteright or \textquoteleftProbable TBM\textquoteright as a gold standard. Discussion The fair to moderate inter-rater agreement and poor sensitivities of the criteria for BME suggest that little reliance should be placed in these features in isolation. While the presence of the CCD criteria of acute infarction or tuberculoma(s) appears useful as rule-in criteria, their absence is of little help in excluding TBM. The CCD and criteria for BME, as well as any new criteria, need to be standardized and validated in prospective cohort studies.},
