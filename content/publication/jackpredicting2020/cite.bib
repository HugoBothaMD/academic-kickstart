  abstract = {Clinical trials with anti-tau drugs will need to target individuals at risk of accumulating tau. Our objective was to identify variables available in a research  setting that predict future rates of tau PET accumulation separately among  individuals who were either cognitively unimpaired or cognitively impaired. All 337  participants had: a baseline study visit with MRI, amyloid PET, and tau PET exams,  at least one follow-up tau PET exam; and met clinical criteria for membership in one  of two clinical diagnostic groups: cognitively unimpaired (n = 203); or cognitively  impaired (n = 134, a combined group of participants with either mild cognitive  impairment or dementia with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome). Our primary analyses  were in these two clinical groups; however, we also evaluated subgroups dividing the  unimpaired group by normal/abnormal amyloid PET and the impaired group by clinical  phenotype (mild cognitive impairment, amnestic dementia, and non-amnestic dementia).  Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate associations between age, sex,  education, APOE genotype, amyloid and tau PET standardized uptake value ratio  (SUVR), cognitive performance, cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensity  volume at baseline, and the rate of subsequent tau PET accumulation. Log-transformed  tau PET SUVR was used as the response and rates were summarized as annual per cent  change. A temporal lobe tau PET meta-region of interest was used. In the cognitively  unimpaired group, only higher baseline amyloid PET was a significant independent  predictor of higher tau accumulation rates (P \textless 0.001). Higher rates of tau  accumulation were associated with faster rates of cognitive decline in  the~cognitively unimpaired subgroup with abnormal amyloid PET (P = 0.03), but among  the subgroup with normal amyloid PET. In the cognitively impaired group, younger age  (P = 0.02), higher baseline amyloid PET (P = 0.05), APOE $\varepsilon$4 (P = 0.05), and better  cognitive performance (P = 0.05) were significant independent predictors of higher  tau accumulation rates. Among impaired individuals, faster cognitive decline was  associated with faster rates of tau accumulation (P = 0.01). While we examined many  possible predictor variables, our results indicate that screening of unimpaired  individuals for potential inclusion in anti-tau trials may be straightforward  because the only independent predictor of high tau rates was amyloidosis. In  cognitively impaired individuals, imaging and clinical variables consistent with  early onset Alzheimer's disease phenotype were associated with higher rates of tau  PET accumulation suggesting this may be a highly advantageous group in which to  conduct proof-of-concept clinical trials that target tau-related mechanisms. The  nature of the dementia phenotype (amnestic versus non-amnestic) did not affect this  conclusion.},
