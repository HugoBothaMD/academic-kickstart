  abstract = {Background
Some patients with progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS) demonstrate a focal area of midbrain hypometabolism on FDG-PET scans which we call the \textquoteleftpimple sign\textquoteright. We assessed its association with midbrain atrophy, its reliability and its ability to differentiate PSPS from corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).
Methods
We identified 67 patients with PSPS, CBS or MSA who had volumetric MRI as well as FDG-PET imaging. Midbrain volume was measured and expressed as a percentage of total intracranial volume. Two independent, blinded specialists rated the \textquoteleftpimple sign\textquoteright on FDG-PET as \textquoteleftabsent\textquoteright, \textquoteleftpossible\textquoteright or \textquoteleftdefinite\textquoteright. Midbrain volumes were compared across these groups and reliability assessed with the kappa statistic. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using CBS and MSA patients as controls.
Results
Midbrain volume was decreased in the \textquoteleftdefinite\textquoteright group compared to the \textquoteleftabsent\textquoteright and \textquoteleftpossible\textquoteright groups (p~=~0.0036). Inter-rater reliability for the pimple sign was high ($\kappa$~=~0.90). A \textquoteleftdefinite pimple sign\textquoteright had a high specificity (100%) but low sensitivity (29%) for PSPS, whilst the presence of a possible or definite sign had a sensitivity of 79%.
Conclusion
The \textquoteleftpimple sign\textquoteright of PSPS is associated with midbrain atrophy, and may be helpful in differentiating PSPS from CBS and MSA.},
