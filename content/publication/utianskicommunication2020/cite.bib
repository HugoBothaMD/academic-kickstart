  abstract = {Purpose Individuals with primary progressive apraxia of speech (AOS) have AOS in which disruptions in articulation and prosody predominate the speech pattern. Many  develop aphasia and/or dysarthria later in the disease course. The aim of this study  was to describe the communication limitations in these patients, as measured by (a)  the patient via the Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB) and (b) the  speech-language pathologist via the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's  (ASHA) Functional Communication Measures (FCMs) and an adapted motor speech disorder  (MSD) severity rating. Method Speech and language evaluations were completed for 24  patients with progressive AOS (n = 7 with isolated AOS; n = 17 with a combination of  AOS and aphasia). Descriptive comparisons were utilized to evaluate differences in  communication measures among patients with various combinations of MSDs and aphasia.  Differences associated with phonetic predominant or prosodic predominant AOS were  also examined. Across the entire cohort, correlations were calculated between the  participation ratings and other clinical assessment measures. Results The CPIB  reflected greater limitations for those with aphasia and AOS compared to isolated  AOS, but was not notably different when dysarthria occurred with AOS (n = 9/24).  Across the cohort, there were statistically significant correlations between the  CPIB and ASHA FCM-Motor Speech and Language Expression ratings and the MSD severity  rating. The CPIB did not correlate with the ASHA FCM-Language Comprehension or other  speech-language measures. Conclusions Patients with neurodegenerative AOS experience  reduced participation in communication that is further exacerbated by co-occurring  language deficits. The study suggests measures of severity cannot be assumed to  correlate with measures of participation restrictions and offers a foundation for  further research examining the day-to-day sequela of progressive speech and language  disorders.
