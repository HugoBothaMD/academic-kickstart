                To compare [
                18
                F]AV-1451 uptake in the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) to Alzheimer dementia, and determine whether increased uptake in svPPA is associated with the presence of $\\beta$-amyloid (A$\\beta$).
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                Thirty-one participants with svPPA underwent MRI and Pittsburgh compound B\textendashPET scanning, and 17 of these also underwent [
                18
                F]AV-1451 tau-PET. A global Pittsburgh compound B standardized uptake value ratio was calculated for all participants, with a cutoff of 1.42 used to define A$\\beta$(+) participants. We assessed region and voxel-level [
                18
                F]AV-1451 uptake in the whole svPPA cohort and separately in A$\\beta$(+) and A$\\beta$(-) svPPA groups, compared to 12 A$\\beta$(+) participants with Alzheimer dementia and 170 cognitively normal, A$\\beta$(-) controls.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Of the entire cohort of participants with svPPA, 26% were A$\\beta$(+). The A$\\beta$(+) participants were older at scan compared to the A$\\beta$(-) participants. svPPA showed elevated [
                18
                F]AV-1451 uptake in anteromedial temporal regions but the degree of uptake was lower than in Alzheimer dementia. After controlling for age, A$\\beta$(+) status in svPPA was associated with significantly higher uptake in all anteromedial and inferior/middle lateral temporal regions, but uptake was still lower than in Alzheimer dementia.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                Although [
                18
                F]AV-1451 uptake is focally elevated in svPPA, the level of uptake is much less than what occurs in Alzheimer dementia and appears to be at least partially related to A$\\beta$. Therefore, it is possible that some of the increased uptake of [
                18
                F]AV-1451 in svPPA is related to binding paired helical filament tau.},
