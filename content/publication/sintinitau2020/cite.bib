  abstract = {The mechanisms through which tau and amyloid-beta (A$\\beta$) accumulate in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients may differ but both are related to neuronal networks.  We examined such mechanisms on neuroimaging in 58 participants with atypical  Alzheimer's disease (posterior cortical atrophy or logopenic progressive aphasia).  Participants underwent A$\\beta$-PET, longitudinal tau-PET, structural MRI and  resting-state functional MRI, which was analyzed with graph theory. Regions with  high levels of A$\\beta$ were more likely to be functional hubs, with a high number of  functional connections important for resilience to cascading network failures.  Regions with high levels of tau were more likely to have low clustering coefficients  and degrees, suggesting a lack of trophic support or vulnerability to local network  failures. Regions strongly functionally connected to the disease epicenters were  more likely to have higher levels of tau and, less strongly, of A$\\beta$. The regional  rate of tau accumulation was associated with tau levels in functionally connected  regions, in support of tau accumulation in a functional network. This study  elucidates the relations of tau and A$\\beta$ to functional connectivity metrics in  atypical Alzheimer's disease, strengthening the hypothesis that the spread of the 2  proteins is driven by different biological mechanisms related to functional  networks.},
