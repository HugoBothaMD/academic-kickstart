  abstract = {Purpose Individuals with primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) have apraxia of speech (AOS) in which disruptions in articulation or prosody predominate the  speech pattern, referred to, respectively, as phonetic or prosodic subtypes. Many  develop aphasia and/or dysarthria. Past research has demonstrated that simple  temporal acoustic measures are sensitive to the presence of AOS. The aim of this  study was to describe the change in temporal acoustic measures over time and assess  if specific patterns of AOS or co-occurring aphasia or dysarthria impact the rate of  change over time. Method Durations for multiple productions of the words cat,  catnip, catapult, and catastrophe, in an imitative speech task, were recorded for 73  patients, with two to six visits each. A linear mixed-effects model was used to  assess the cross-sectional differences and longitudinal influence of AOS subtype and  presence of aphasia/dysarthria on speech rate. Pearson correlations were calculated  between rate measures and performance on other clinical measures. Results  Cross-sectionally, patients with prosodic-predominant PPAOS produced words more  slowly than those with phonetic-predominant PPAOS. Patients with either aphasia or  dysarthria produced words more slowly than those without. Longitudinally, the speech  rate of patients with phonetic-predominant PPAOS had a reduction of 0.5 syllables  per second per year. Patients with prosodic-predominant AOS changed less quickly, as  did those who developed aphasia. Dysarthria did not impact rate of change. There  were strong associations between speech rate measures and other clinical indices of  speech and language functioning. Conclusion Simple temporal acoustic measures may  reflect the subtype of AOS (phonetic or prosodic predominant), serve as an index of  progression of AOS, and inform prognostication relative to the presenting  combination of speech and language features.
