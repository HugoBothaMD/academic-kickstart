Hugo Botha is Senior Associate Consultant in Behavioral Neurology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and Assistant Professor of Neurology in the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science. Most of his research is focussed on using multimodal neuroimaging and deep phenotyping to understand  how the brain and mind change with aging, the pathobiology of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, and the clinico-imaging-pathologic correlates of degenerative motor speech disorders.
